## Purpose

This web-page aims to showcase my work & experience
on computer science over the years, allowing people to connect
with me on social media using direct links to all my accounts.

## How it works

This project is pretty dynamic, meaning that no resource, other than
the topic headers, is hard-coded. Most information is retrieved from
the [GitHub Api](https://api.github.com), keeping project
names, description & links up to date at all times.
Projects are classified based on their topics list and sorted first by their
watchers count, starring those having at least 1
& then by their latest modification time, putting the most recently updated on
top of their corresponding topic list.

## How to run and develop

1. Please run `npm install` for all dependencies to be installed
2. Then, `npm run build` to build the project, converting JSX to vanilla JS, don't wait for it to stop
3. Finally, please run `npm start` for the application to start

To develop, replace the 2 very steps with `npm run dev`.  
This is both running a tiny server at port 3000 and watching for any code changes to be compiled.
